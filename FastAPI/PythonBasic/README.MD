## ✅ Today's Tasks

| Module | Description | Filename |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| Data Structures | Lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples | [`01_data_structures.py`](./01_data_structures.py) |
| Functions & Control Flow | `if`, `for`, `while`, `return` | [`02_functions.py`](./02_functions.py) |
| Classes & OOP | Custom classes, Inheritance, Polymorphism  | [`03_classes.py`](./03_classes.py) |
| Comprehensions & Lambda | List/dict/set comprehensions, `lambda` | [`04_comprehensions.py`](./04_comprehensions.py) |
| Modules & Imports | Using standard libraries | [`05_modules.py`](./05_modules.py) |
| Summary Notes | Syntax highlights & reflections | `notes.md` |

## 💡 Key Concepts

- Python is indentation-based (no curly braces like JS)
- Functions are first-class objects (assign, pass, return)
- Everything is an object (even classes, types, and functions)
- Strong support for built-in data types and standard libraries
- Comprehensions and generators are powerful tools for concise logic

---

## 📝 Submission Requirements

- Each `.py` file includes:
  - At least 1 example
  - Comments explaining the logic
- In `notes.md`, reflect on:
  - Syntax patterns you reviewed
  - Main differences from JavaScript
  - Self-assessment: What’s familiar vs. unfamiliar?
